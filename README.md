# VideoPlaybackSpeedChromeExtension
It works (for now) on a page with only one video element. I should say, for the first video element.

## How To
1. Download the zip.
2. Unzip.
3. Go to Chrome's extensions page and switch on the developer mode (top right).
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the unzipped folder.
